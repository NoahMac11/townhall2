            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board 
                of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking 
                speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:
            </p>
            <q>Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of 
                knowledge...and that is priceless.</q>
